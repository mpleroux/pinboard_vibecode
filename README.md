# README

An experiment to vibecode a barebones, single user clone of the social bookmarking website Pinboard using Claude Code. Bookmarking utilities are undoubtedly easy for LLMs to create given how much prior art already exists out there.

All updates were created [using prompts](docs/prompt-history.md) to help me become more familiar with the process of vibecoding and its limitations. Claude did an impressive job at first, creating a functional single page bookmarking app after the first detailed prompt. Using additional prompts to add features like import/export and light/dark mode also went smoothly.

Claude stumbled when I asked it to convert the HTML page to a local project built with `npm` and run with `Vite`. The page appeared broken in the browser because it didn't recognize Tailwind classes. After several unsuccessful attempts to generate the necessary project configuration with Claude I decided to end this brief experiment. I plan to [recreate the project](https://github.com/mpleroux/web_bookmarks) using React and Next.js and this repo can serve as inspiration.

I am in the process of learning a more professional AI workflow which utilizes skills, subagents, etc. in Traversy Media's [Coding with AI](https://www.traversymedia.com/coding-with-ai) course.
